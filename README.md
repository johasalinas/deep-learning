## Goals

In this assignment you will practice putting together a simple image classification pipeline based on the k-Nearest Neighbor or the Softmax classifier. The goals of this assignment are as follows:


Understand basic neural network architecture.
Understand the basic Image Classification pipeline and the data-driven approach (train/predict stages).
Understand the train/val/test splits and the use of validation data for hyperparameter tuning.
Develop proficiency in writing efficient vectorized code with numpy.
Implement and apply a Two layer neural network classifier.


Q1: Simple neural network example

Go through the notebook and complete the exercises

Q2: Two-Layer Neural Network

The notebook two_layer_net.ipynb will walk you through the implementation of a two-layer neural network classifier. 

* k-Nearest Neighbor classifier

The notebook knn.ipynb will walk you through implementing the kNN classifier.

* Implement a Softmax classifier (Optional)

The notebook softmax.ipynb will walk you through implementing the Softmax classifier.

### What to hand in:
* Code on Github
* Short report answering questions from the code (hand-written or computer-written)
* Hand-written derivations for the implementations of the: Affine-forward, Affine-backward, ReLU forward, ReLU-backward.




## BONUS points
At the lab session after the hand-in of this Lab, you have a chance to get up to **2** bonus points for presenting a part of the solution. Specifically:
* Simple neural network notebook
* Two-layer-net notebook
* Math derivations of forward/back prop 

Each presentation will be approximately 5-10 minutes and consist of you going through your solution together as a group and answering any clarifying questions.
